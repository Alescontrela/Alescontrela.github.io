I'm a PhD student advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). Before that, I completed my undergrad at Georgia Tech, advised by [Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/). I was also a Research Intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) from 2018-2021. My work is supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and robotics. Specifically, my work focuses on extracting behavior priors for RL agents from internet data, making RL super sample efficient, and leveraging large generative models as priors.
