I'm a PhD student advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) and [Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/), and an intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), where I have worked for three years. I completed my undergrad at Georgia Tech, advised by [Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/). My work is supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and robotics. Specifically, my work focuses on extracting behavior priors for RL agents from internet data, making RL super sample efficient, and leveraging large generative models as priors.
