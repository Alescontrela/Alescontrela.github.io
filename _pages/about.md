I'm Alejandro, a 2nd year PhD student in the EECS program at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel and Ken Goldberg. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and robotics. Specifically, my work focuses on extracting behavior priors for RL agents from internet data, making RL super sample efficient, and pushing robots to their limits. I also spend 20% of my time at Google Brain, where I help the Google Robotics team make robots more intelligent.

I have interned at Google Brain for 3 years, and completed my undergraduate education at Georgia Tech, advised by <a href='https://dellaert.github.io/'>Frank Dellart</a>. My work is supported by the <a href='https://www.nsfgrfp.org/'>NSF</a> and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.

I normally work with students close to graduation who have taken intro to AI (CS188/288 or equivalent), reinforcement learning (CS285), and/or robotics (CS287), and have a GPA >= 3.5.
