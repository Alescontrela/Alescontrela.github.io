<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span class="font-weight-bold">Hi! I'm Alejandro!</span> I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student at <a href='https://bair.berkeley.edu/'>Berkeley AI Research</a> advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/).  My work is supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.</span>

I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and robotics. Specifically, my work focuses on extracting behavior priors for RL agents from internet data, making RL super sample efficient, and leveraging large generative models as priors. Before joining BAIR, I completed my undergrad at Georgia Tech, advised by [Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/). I was also a Research Intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) from 2018-2022.
