I'm Alejandro, a 2nd year PhD student in the EECS program at UC Berkeley, advised by Pieter Abbeel and Ken Goldberg. I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and robotics. Specifically, my work focuses on extracting behavior priors for RL agents from internet data, making RL super sample efficient, and pushing robots to their limits. I also spend 20% of my time at Google Brain, where I help the Google Robotics team make robot more intelligent.


In my free time I like to hike, ski, travel, and fantasize about the existence of a modern transportation system in California. 

<span class="font-weight-bold">For undergrads:</span> if you're interested in mentorship / collaboration, please fill out this google form (TODO). I normally work with students close to graduation who have taken intro to AI (CS181/281 or equivalent), reinforcement learning (CS284), and/or robotics (TODO).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
